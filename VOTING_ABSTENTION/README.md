# Open data on non-voting in Greece and EU

This is a repository for a project on non-voters in Greece and in Europe. [iMEdD Lab](https://lab.imedd.org/) contributed with its work to the relevant cross-border project “[The Non-Voter Time Bomb]”(https://lab.imedd.org/en/i-vomva-tis-apochis-apo-tis-ekloges-diachronika-ana-tin-evropi/), led by [Divergente](https://divergente.pt/en/) with the contribution of twelve other journalistic organizations —members of the [EDJNet](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/). After this cross-border project, iMEdD Lab updated the datasets provided here with elections turnout data for Greece after the EU elections in June 2024.<br>
